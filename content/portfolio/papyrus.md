description: "A site with continuous development"

This site was original developed in 2018. Since then I have completed a series improvements along with adding extended functionality. These have included:
- adding WPML to the site and connecting this with the ACF fields used to build the original site.
- Optimizing the site speed for both Mobile and Desktop.

The most recent expansion of functionality to the site was adding a connection between Blackbaud Raisers Edge and the site. This was achieved using the Blackbaud Sky API which required a custom plugin to be developed along with custom WP-Cron jobs to refresh the Auth key every 60 minutes as required by the SKY API. This plugin also created a connection with WooCommerce to manage event bookings and push the details back to the Raisers Edge CRM.
