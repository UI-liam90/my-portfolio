description: "A site with continuous development"
---

This is a recent project I completed while freelancing for an agency. This was a WordPress build for a Modern Church located within Warrington. As a whole the site doesn't have much in the way of custom functionality and is for now just a basic information website, in the future there might be further development for event bookings and live video broadcasting.

I wanted to play around with WordPress Gutenburg Block Editor and this seemed to be the perfect site to do that on. I create some custom blocks using ACF to get used how the Block Editor worked and functions (in fact the homepage is comprised of just the ACF custom blocks and no native WordPress Blocks have been used). In the future I want to look into creating blocks using native React method, but for now the ACF Block method seems to work with very little issue.
